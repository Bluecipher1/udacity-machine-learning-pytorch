    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "#### Gradient Boosting\n",
    "Gradient boosting is an ensemble classifier, combining several trained weak learners into a strong learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gradient boosting can be used for both classification and regression problems and has many applications in industry, e.g. learning-to-rank in search engine (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting#Usage)) \n",
    "- The strength of this model mainly lies in its excellence performance, as it usually outperforms many other classifiers (see https://medium.com/gradient-boosting-working-limitations-time/gradient-boosting-working-and-applications-28e8d4ba866d)\n",
    "- Gradient boosting can have a bad performance and latency if the data dimensionality is high. Also, its results are difficult to interpret (also https://medium.com/gradient-boosting-working-limitations-time/gradient-boosting-working-and-applications-28e8d4ba866d).\n",
    "- As our data have low dimensionality and ask for a simple binary classification, Gradient Boosting would be a good fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logistic Regression\n",
    "Logistic regression is one of the oldest and simplest methods for classification problems.\n",
    "- Logistic Regression is well suited to be used for typical classification problems like credit scoring (see https://activewizards.com/blog/5-real-world-examples-of-logistic-regression-application).\n",
    "- Its main strength are simplicity, speed and transparency. It usually runs fast, and its results explain why a certain decision has been made by the model\n",
    "- Being not overly sophisticated, there are other models which may outperform the logistic regression approach.\n",
    "- Being a binary classification problem, logistic regression would be a good fit. Also, the interpreatbility of the trained parameters might give some insights what to look for in a possible donor that might be transferable to other situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision Trees\n",
    "Decision Trees are also a good classification (as well as regression) model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Trees can be easily represented in a visual format and be used e.g. to support management decisions or medical diagnosis\n",
    "- Their strength lie in their simplicity and white box nature and can be well represented in a decision graph (see https://activewizards.com/blog/5-real-world-examples-of-logistic-regression-application).\n",
    "- Decision Trees tend to overfit, this has to be carefully monitored during the training process using cross-validation.\n",
    "- Similar to Logistic Regression, the simplicity, speed and transparency of this model are appealing."

    "### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline\n",
    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",
    "   - Record the total prediction time.\n",
    " - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    " - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",

    "Based on our initial evaluation, we suggest to continue using the GradientBoosting model for usage on this data set. While it does have a significantly higher training time (about an oder of magnitude higher than both Logistic Regression and Decision Trees), this is of secondary concern in our application, since its training is still small and we do not require real time prediction. The GradientBoosting makes up for this weakness with a better performance on the complete testing data set. DecisionTrees show a clear tendency to overfit, and while some of that might be remedied by hyperparameter tuning, the potential optimized performance of GradientBoosting promises to be higher and less prone to variance issues."

    "Gradient boosting is one of the ensemble methods in machine learning, which means it combines a number of very simple and specialized predictors into one very complex and capable model. This can be likened to the conceot of a swarm intelligence, meaning the combination of a lot of opinions results in a performance that none of its simple parts could ever achieve.\n",

    "There are significant differences between my intuition and the actual weights. Some of the features were not at all in my list, while others have a different rank than in my guess. I correctly guessed capital-gain, hours-per-week and education-num to be in the top-five, but I missed age and marital-status. The former can be easily explained, as most people receive a better income with higher age as they are able to acquire higher-income jobs and are rewarded for their larger experience. I am somewhat surprised by the occurrence of the marital status in the top five features, but probably people only tend to enagage in a marriage when their financial status is solid."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "The F-score for the reduced training set sinks from about 0.75 to 0.7, indicating that the model generalizes less well than the original model. However, the training was significantly shorter. Given the use case and data set of this example, it does not really make sense to reduce the features, as the training process is a one-time event. In addition, making this decision regarding the structure of the model based on insights gained from the training data set violates the rule that precisely that should not be done."
