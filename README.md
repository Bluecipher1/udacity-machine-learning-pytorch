# udacity-machine-learning-pytorch
My solutions to projects in Udacity's "Intro to Machine Learning with PyTorch"

## Installing and running the projects
All projects are implemented using Jupyter Notebooks and Python 3.5. The following packages must be installed to run the notebooks:

- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn (v0.17)
- Matplotlib

To execute a project simply start the corresponding notebook server using

```jupyter notebook <notebook_name.ipynb>```
